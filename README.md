### Hi there 👋
I'm Aesha -- a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech (concentrations in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence) with minors in Law, Science, & Technology and Financial Technology. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aeshashah7/)! <br>

I mostly build with Python, Java, and HTML/CSS/JS, but I also love learning new languages/stacks (currently working on C/C++!). More details about my experience & projects can be found on my portfolio, [https://aeshashah726.github.io/](https://aeshashah726.github.io/). 🚀✨
