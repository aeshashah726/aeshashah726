### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Aesha *(AY-shuh)* -- a Computer Science major at Georgia Tech, with concentrations in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence, and a minor in Law, Science, & Technology. <br>

I most ofen build with Python, Java, and HTML/CSS/JS, but I also love learning new languages/stacks (i'm currently working on C/C++!). More details about my experience & projects can be found on my portfolio, [https://aeshashah726.github.io/](https://aeshashah726.github.io/). ðŸš€âœ¨
